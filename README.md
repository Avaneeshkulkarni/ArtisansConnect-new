1. ABSTRACT - 

The purpose of this research is to build a bridge between artisans and urban area. In India, traditional artisans are the backbone of the country's rich cultural heritage, creating a wide range of handmade products that reflect centuries of skills and traditions. Despite their expertise, many artisans struggle to access broader markets due to limited digital literacy, lack of marketing skills, and dependence on middlemen who take a significant portion of their earnings. This has resulted in declining interest among newer generations to pursue these crafts, threatening the survival of traditional art forms.
ARTISANS-CONNECT aims to bridge this gap by developing a dedicated online marketplace exclusively for handmade and artisanal products. The platform is designed to be intuitive, multilingual, and user-friendly, specifically keeping in mind artisans with minimal digital experience. It not only offers direct-to-customer sales channels but also integrates artisan profiles and storytelling features to build stronger emotional connections with customers. Additionally, the project proposes conducting training sessions for artisans in basic digital marketing, product presentation, and order fulfilment.
The initiative is scalable and sustainable, with the potential to expand into new categories like sustainable fashion and home decor, and eventually into international markets. By eliminating intermediaries, promoting fair pricing, and empowering artisans to manage their businesses independently, ARTISANS-CONNECT envisions a positive societal impact through economic upliftment, preservation of cultural heritage, and promotion of ethical consumerism. Through low-cost development and a commission-based revenue model, the project ensures feasibility and long-term self-sustainability.
